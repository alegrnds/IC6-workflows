# Explanation

This section provides a deeper understanding of the concepts and reasoning behind the functions and calculations used in this project. Here, you’ll learn **why** the functions behave the way they do and the principles behind the logic and formulas.

## Thermostat Logic (`my_thermo_stat`)

The thermostat function determines whether to turn on the heat, the AC, or stay off based on the current temperature (`temp`) and the desired temperature (`desired_temp`).

- **Heat triggers** when the room is significantly colder than desired (`temp < desired_temp - 5`).  
- **AC triggers** when the room is significantly hotter than desired (`temp > desired_temp + 5`).  
- **Off** occurs when the temperature is within ±5 degrees of the desired value.  

This ±5 degree range provides a buffer to prevent wear out the system of the thermostat and be inefficient.

## Rectangle Calculations (`area_of_rectangle`, `perimeter_of_rectangle`)

- **Area**: The area of a rectangle is calculated as `width × height`. This represents the amount of space inside the rectangle.  
- **Perimeter**: The perimeter is `2 × (width + height)`, which measures the total length around the rectangle.  

These formulas come directly from basic geometry and are implemented in functions to allow repeated calculation without rewriting the logic.

## Simple Arithmetic (`my_adder`)

The `my_adder` function adds two numbers together. This illustrates the concept of **reusable functions**, where a single definition can perform the same operation on different inputs.

## String Checks (`have_digits`)

The `have_digits` function checks whether a string contains any digits. Conceptually, this demonstrates **iteration and condition checking**:

- The function loops through each character of the string.  
- It uses a conditional check (`c.isdigit()`) to identify numbers.  
- It stops as soon as a digit is found, showing **efficient early termination**.
