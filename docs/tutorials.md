# **Tutorials**

In this page, we are going to learn how to use the area of the [rectangle function][functions.area_of_rectangle]!

Functions are really good when we want to calculate a quantity with different numbers, but do not want to repeat the operation over and over again.  

Imagine you have 5 different rectangles, and you are tasked to calculate the area of them. Instead of taking the calculator, you can calculate it using this function!

I recommend looking at documentation and know what type of variable the function takes.

Now that you are familiar with the function, we can get started!

First, we have to define the width and height of the rectangle.

```py
width = 3.00
height = 5.00
```
With the variables defined, we know can use the function:

```py
a = area_of_rectangle(width, height)
print(a) #should output 15.0
```
Try changing the values of `width` and `height` youself to see how the result changes!
